Git – Git is a  Distributed Version Control System.
In github first sign-up then after sign-up or login you can create Repository with initializing READ ME option.
Now you have created Repository then Click on Create file and write what type of file you want create whether txt,java,php or c because Git understands all files.
Then do something in that file and commit it and again do some changes and commit it and continue doing so.Now if you want check what changes have you made till now then go to ‘Source’ means click on ‘Source’ then click on ‘Commits’ then all Files with appear with changes you made then go inside that file or choose file and check it then click on ‘view option’ at right side and after view you can do editing by clicking on Edit option and after editing commit it.
While editing a file there may be a chance that it may be very important changes and you want to save it separately then for that after doing editing or changes you create a new branch which option will be given at bottom then name new branch and click on ’Propose file changes’ button then it will be saved in new branch.
Now if you want to merge two branch means your Maser Branch and created branch  then for that Click on Repository which you have created once  then we will get option of ‘Compare & Pull Request’ if we click on that then it will say can’t merge automatically then to resolve this issue at bottom one option is given ‘Create Pull request’ just click on it then it shows where the issue is and one option ‘Resolve conflicts’ is given just click it. Then if you find that ‘Propose file changes’ that important changes  are made in  between committing final changes so just do changes accordingly means remove’ file name’ with the changes and click on commit merge option.
Then it will say this branch has no conflicts and now you need to click on ‘Merge pull request’ button and then click on Confirm Merge.  
Now you can go to ‘code’ and go ‘Master’ and click on your file which you have created.
